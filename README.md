    Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

    Our client, The Gaming Room, wants to create a project that is a web-based game based on the game draw it or lose it and will be hosted on multiple platforms. The objective of the game is multiple teams, each containing multiple players, playing for four rounds each one minute long. In these rounds a picture is pulled and presented to the teams and one team guesses until time runs out. If not answered each of the other teams will get 15 seconds to guess.
    
    What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

    I did well at trying to stay unbiased in my research, which allowed me to give recommendations based purely on what would work best for the clients needs.
    
    What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

    
    
    If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
    
    How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

    It's important to consider the user's needs because they are supporting your product and should have a good expirience when using it. If they don't like the application they will find someone else to solve their problems which makes it important to consider their opinion on what they are looking for.
    
    How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
